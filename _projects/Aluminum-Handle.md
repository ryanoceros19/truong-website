excerpt: "Through Autodesk’s *Project in a Box* program, I learned CNC machining by modeling and CAM-programming a speed vise handle in Fusion 360—overcoming version differences and a new interface with TA mentorship—while also gaining hands-on experience in tool setup, machine operation, and basic 3D printing.

My first major introduction to CNC Machining was through the "Project in a Box" program offered by Autodesk. My TA Mentor guided me through the project, overlooking the process. The project invovled modeling the speed vice handle from scratch. This primarily involved following the video tutorial. Despite the video instructions, some features/steps were unclear or inconsistent between versions of Fusion360. It was also challenging learning a new user interface since I only had experience with SolidWorks. My mentor helped familiarize me with the newer version and accomplish the same goals with this newer version. Then I programmed the CAM, again following the video tutorial. This taught me the different features of programming CAM including setting speeds and feeds, tool information, and the varying selection of tool paths that can be used to create unique features.

After completing the tutorial, my mentor taught me how to build tools properly. She then had us install tools into the CNC mill. She taught us how to set up the program on the machine and check tool heights. She also introduced a very brief 3-D printing tutorial for the plastic handles she printed for us to use.
