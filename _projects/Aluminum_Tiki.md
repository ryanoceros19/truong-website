Upon joining a new organization, my "big" or mentor gifted me a wooden tiki. It displayed the symbols of our organization and had a spade at the top. This represented me since I was in a dance group called "Ace Dance Company" and was the first in my group, often called the "Ace" of the line". As a thank you to my mentor, I wanted to gift him something unique. I realized that a metal tiki would not only be unique since tikis were typically constructed of wood, it would be a great opportunity for me to apply my CNC skills.

I began by finding a particular design of the organization's letters that I believed looked attractive. Then I made rough sketches of the tiki. This helped me figure out what shape to make the tiki and how to format the custom text I wanted to engrave. I went through several iterations to accomadate design for manufacturing and overall aesthetics.

After finalizing the design, I modeled the general shape of the tiki first. I converted the organizations logo from an image to an SVG file so Fusion360 could read it. I also wrote the custom text in Microsoft Word and coverted the file to SVG. Using the SVG files, I was able to create a recess on the front in the shape of the organization's logo. On the back, I engraved custom text that included my big's information in the model. Then I determined what tools would be needed for each feature. I  input the information for each of the tools including speeds and feeds and programmed the toolpaths using the tools.

Once a peer checked my CAM, I built the tools and installed them into the CNC Mill. I ran the program to cut and engrave the back, checking my tool heights as I went. After finishing the CAM I realized that I had not only cut my stock too short, broke an endmill because I forgot to account for the vice after a modification, but there was a typo in his name. Fixing all of these issues, I proceeded to replace the tool and run the program, finishing both sides of the tiki. I gave him the tiki over lunch and he was very excited about his new and unique memorabilia.
